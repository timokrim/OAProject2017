# OAProject2017
This is app project was created in school for learning matter.
The idea of the app is to get user profile (hard coded) and some random people (hard coded).
And then you could search for new friends based on your profile information.
You could for example filter your listed music or tv series nad the app would show you all people who share the same music or tv serieses as you. Then you could choose to add them to your "friend list" or "maybe list".

The data will not be in this repository for reasons.
